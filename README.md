# Greetings!

(For now) It's pretty empty here, but that's okay. :)

Anyway, this file will contain any and all documentation for this module, starting with:


 **Day 1**:

- **Git**:                   Used for version control, collabs, branching and merging, code review etc.
- **node.js**:               Open-Source JavaScript runtime environment; allows running server side JavaScript
- **TypeScript Compiler**:   Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- **Visual Studio Code**:    Open-Source code editor by Microsoft
- **Repository**:            A *Repository* is a storage location for project files; handy for collaborations, as it allows version control and collaborations.
- **Commit**:                A *Commit* is a snapshot of changes made to a repository - also shows the changes made.
- **Branch**:                A *Branch* is a parallel version of a repository, separate from the main one.
- **Remote**:                Basically everything not local.
- **Stage**:                 Changes to be made to a repository before a commit. Changes made will go to the Stage Area.
- **Fetch**:                 Process of downloading commits, files and references from a remote repository.
- **Pull**:                  Fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into a local branch.
- **Push**:                  Sending local commits to a remote repository.
- **Merge**:                 Combining changes from different branches into a single branch.

**Problems**: 
- How to exclude a file from being tracked by Git
- Roll back everything to the last commit: Discarding all the changes permanently, or temporarily
- How to remove all untracked files from local folder;
- What are the differences between merge strategies: *merge, rebase, squash*


 **Day 2**: 
 
 Lots of catching up to do.

-Introduction to HTML: lol, skip that

 **Day 3**: 

-Working with CSS and HTML, experimenting with pages etc.
